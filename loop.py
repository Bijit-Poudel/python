#Loop is used to repeat the same code again and again
#Two types of loop in Python- while loop and for loop
#loop that never stops is infinite loop

# i = 0                           #Example of
# while i < 5:                    #While
#     print("Hello World")        #loop
#     i += 1                      



# names = ["ram", "shyam","hari","rita"]
# i = 0
# while i< len(names):
#     print(names[i])
#     i +=1

# for loop

# names = ['ram', 'shyam', 'hari', 'rita'] #stops automatically when values end
# for name in names:
#     print(name)


# names = ['ram', 'shyam', 'hari', 'rita'] #stops automatically when values end
# for name in names:
#     print(name.capitalize())

# names = ['ram', 'shyam','hari', 'rita']
# for n in names:

#         break


# roll_no = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
# for n in roll_no:
#     if n == 6:
#         print('Number found')
#         break #break stops the loop completely

#         # continue stops the current iteration and pass it to the next iteration

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
